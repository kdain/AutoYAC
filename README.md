Send to YAC for Asterisk CallerID Superfecta that sends to multiple listeners

You must edit the getlist file to support your network settings. 

Replace 192.168.1.x with your local subnet.

Also, edit the installer's crontab setting to suit your system.

Hope this helps, it works very well on my system with the Media Center plugin.  I get callerID on my TV,
and also on my other machines that have the YAC listener installed.  

Google sunflowerhead to find the YAC listener.


bcid may also be used to send short text messages to all YAC listeners.

Example: echo Lunch is ready | bcid
